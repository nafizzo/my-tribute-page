                        <dt class="col-sm-3">Early life</dt>
                        <dd class="col-sm-9">
                            <p>During his childhood, Kjellberg was interested in art and has detailed that he would draw popular video game characters such as Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. During high school, he frequently played video games in his bedroom and would skip classes to play video games at an Internet café with friends.During his last year of high school, he bought a computer with the money he made selling artwork through his grandmother's gallery.[9] Kjellberg then went on to pursue a degree. He left Chalmers to focus on his YouTube career, Kjellberg clarified that he left because of his lack of interest in his course of study.</p>

                        <dt class="col-sm-3">Start of internet carrier</dt>
                        <dd class="col-sm-9">Kjellberg originally registered a YouTube account under the name "Pewdie" in December 2006; he explained that "pew" represents the sound of lasers and "die" refers to dying.After initially forgetting the password to this account, he registered the "PewDiePie" YouTube channel on 29 April 2010. Following his exit from Chalmers, his parents refused to financially support him, so he funded his early videos by working as a harbor captain, selling prints of his Photoshop art, and working at a hot dog stand.Kjellberg's oldest video available for viewing is titled "Minecraft Multiplayer Fun".Fridays with PewDiePie is a notable set of videos uploaded by Kjellberg towards the beginning portion of his YouTube career. The series was a weekly deviation from the Let's Play videos that formed most of his content output at the time, and often featured vlogs and Kjellberg completing viewer requests.

                        <dt class="col-sm-3">Becoming an Youtube Star</dt>
                        <dd class="col-sm-9">On 18 February 2013, Kjellberg's channel reached 5 million subscribers.In July 2013, he overtook Jenna Marbles to become the second most-subscribed YouTube user, and reached 10 million subscribers on 9<sup>th</sup> July.Kjellberg's subscriber count surpassed that of the leading channel, Smosh, on 15 August 2013.In 2013, the channel grew from 3.5 million to just under 19 million subscribers.In 2014 alone, Kjellberg's account amassed nearly 14 million new subscribers and over 4.1 billion total views.<br><br> September 2015, Kjellberg teased about having a role in a web television series, stating that he was in Los Angeles for the show's shooting.Although not many details were revealed at the time, it was later announced that the series would be an original YouTube Red series titled Scare PewDiePie.The series premiered the following February.</dd>

                        <dt class="col-sm-3">Controversies, backlashes and formatted shows</dt>
                        <dd class="col-sm-9"> Kjellberg uploaded a video where he used a racial slur.[95] The video garnered criticism and widespread attention on Twitter.[96] In another video, Kjellberg featured two paid individuals on Fiverr, asked to hold a sign that read "Death to all Jews". He alleged his intent was not against Jews, but to "showcase how crazy the website was".The video received negative attention and caused a media backlash, with various publications writing critically of Kjellberg's defense of his controversial content as jokes taken out of context, and opining that his content helps normalise ideologies such as fascism, neo-Nazism, and white supremacy.The Wall Street Journal alleged that this was not the first time Kjellberg had used anti-Semitic language and imagery in his videos.Kjellberg and the two individuals later apologised,but the event led Maker Studios to cut their ties with Kjellberg and Google to drop him from the Google Preferred advertising program and cancel the upcoming second season of the Scare PewDiePie YouTube Red series.Ultimately, he apologised for his jokes, but strongly rebuked media coverage of the event, with particular criticism aimed at The Wall Street Journal.<br><br> September 2017, Kjellberg drew criticism again when he used the racial slur "nigger" during an outburst at another player while live-streaming PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. As a response to the incident, Campo Santo co-founder Sean Vanaman referred to Kjellberg as "worse than a closeted racist", announced that Campo Santo would file copyright strikes against Kjellberg's videos featuring the studio's game Firewatch, and encouraged other game developers to do the same.Kjellberg later uploaded a short video apologising for the language he used during the live-stream, expressing "I'm disappointed in myself because it seems like I've learned nothing from all these past controversies, [using the slur] was not okay.</dd>

                        <dd class="col-sm-9">On 5 October 2018, Kjellberg uploaded a diss track against Indian record label T-Series titled "TSERIES DISS TRACK" (later renamed "Bitch Lasagna") in response to their YouTube channel being projected to surpass his in subscribers. It included some lines mocking the Indian background of T-Series, such as the line “Your language sounds like it come  from a mumblerap community” which have been described as racist in media publications.Online campaigns to "subscribe to PewDiePie" greatly assisted Kjellberg's subscriber growth; his channel gained 6.62 million subscribers in December 2018 alone, compared to the 7 million subscribers gained in all of 2017.On 15 March, the perpetrator of the live-streamed Christchurch mosque shootings said "remember lads, subscribe to PewDiePie" before carrying out the attacks. In response, Kjellberg tweeted his disgust after having his name associated with the attack and offered condolences to those affected by the tragedy.After briefly gaining the title several times in early 2019, on 27 March, T-Series surpassed Kjellberg in subscribers to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube. On 31 March, Kjellberg posted another diss track music video, titled "Congratulations", ironically congratulating T-Series for obtaining the title.Many of the song's lyrics were performed in a sarcastic tone, at the expense of T-Series. In the music video, Kjellberg mocked T-Series and its actions.On 14 February, Kjellberg uploaded a diss track titled "Coco" about Cocomelon, a kids-oriented channel which had been rising in subscribers for several years and was growing by nearly 2 million subscribers per month.The video was later taken down by YouTube who claimed that it violated their policies on harassment and child safety.</dd>

                        <dd class="col-sm-9">Kjellberg married his long-time Italian girlfriend Marzia Bisognin on 19 August 2019. The two were introduced to each other through a friend of Bisognin's in 2011, and after establishing an online relationship, Kjellberg flew to Italy to meet her.The pair shuffled between Sweden and Italy, before settling in Brighton and Hove, England.Kjellberg explained that they moved to the UK in July 2013 for preference to live close to the sea and for better Internet connectivity. He says he enjoys living in Brighton and Hove, as he is able to live in general anonymity. They also have a home in Japan.

                            Regarding his political beliefs, Kjellberg stated in October 2019 that he is "more apolitical than anything," and that he was "somewhere in between" left-wing and right-wing.In June 2014, Kjellberg stated that he is an agnostic atheist.
                            
                            Kjellberg has frequently mentioned in videos that he adheres to a pescetarian diet for various reasons.In July 2019, Kjellberg talked about his whiskey addiction during a Cold Ones podcast interview.</dd>
